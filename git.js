// git status - shows which files are be being tracked
//  get init - initializes repository
// git (filename) - starts tracking files
//  git commit -m      -commit -m "comment why you're adding the code"
//  git add (fileName)
//  git log - tells you changes to all the files that are being tracked
// git log (filename) - changes for one specific files (DONT USE)
//   git log -- (filename) - changes for speicfic file

//  if you put a hash then it gives you trhfe most recent one, if not then it brings up the latest file
//  (less) (program name) - shows you the contents of a text file
// rm 
//  git commit --amend (vim will show up and then enter wq(writequit))
//  cat (prints out the commands)
//  git diff shows the changes
//  git add -A (adds all modified files)
// git fetch - pulls a commit from the remote github - went into local directory.
//  then use git merge to take the local repository and merges it with working copy.

// git pull - does both fetch and merge
//  if the changes on github and the changes on the local directory are in two different places
//  it will not work
// Is there a command to over write? (yes, its confusing, later)
//  what would be the command to pull something out of github?
